                <p className="about-sights__p">Most wild Dutch plant species are of the Atlantic district within the
                    Euro-Siberian phytogeographic region. Gradients of salt and winter temperature variations cause
                    relatively minor zonal differences in both wild and garden plants from the coast to more continental
                    regions.</p>
                <p className="about-sights__p">The effects of elevation are negligible. Vegetation from coastal sand
                    dunes, muddy coastal areas, slightly brackish lakes, and river deltas is especially scarce in the
                    surrounding countries. Lakes, marshes, peatland, woods, heaths, and agricultural areas determine the
                    general floral species. Clay, peat, and sand are important soil factors for the inland vegetation
                    regions.</p>
